# Bootcamp

Welcome to our bootcamp reference material!

Here you can find all the information on how the bootcamp works. From the course materials, to the schedule and our projects.

This repository is for everyone to click around and contribute with a pull request.

This project is heavily inspired by [Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/).
