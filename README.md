## Mentorship weeks 13-20

You will be followed by our mentors in developing further your skills and applying for jobs. You can continue working on your project, on client work, or whatever you like, in the same environment with your coursemates and mentors.
You are also invited in mentoring the next cohort of Turn into Coders, to improve your understanding and help running the project.
