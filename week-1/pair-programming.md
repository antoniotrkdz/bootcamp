# Pair programming workshop


## Learning outcomes

- overcome weirdness of pairing
- practice different styles
- understand the benefits


## Why pairing

- collectively own the codebase
- build better software by thinking more
- share knowledge across team members
- learn how to communicate about code


## Task

1. Form a pair
1. Pick a simple kata
1. One person has the keyboard the other closes the laptop
1. Code for 15 minutes
1. Swap roles
1. Code for 15 minutes

Try to stick to the timing so that you can swap pair and try it again.


## Gotchas

Both driver and co-pilot should keep their role for the time that they have decided upfront. It is like role-playing, keep your role for your turn. When the time is up you will swap and have the opportunity to take on the other role.

Pair programming is a soft skill, there aren't strict rules. Especially at the beginning it will feel weird and time wasting, but practicing will show the real value, especially on more complex projects.


### Driver

- remember to describe your thought while coding
- discuss high level implementations


### Co-pilot

- ask questions every time you don't understand something
- try not to influence too much the driver
