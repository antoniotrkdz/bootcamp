# Week 1 - Project


## Build a one-page portfolio website

In the first week we ask you to build your team's portfolio website.

You'll use the website you build here to showcase all the projects we'll build in the following weeks, so don't worry getting it perfect now, you'll have time to refine it.

With this project you should familiarise with these [learning outcomes](learning-outcomes.md).

This project can be built in **one big team**.

Following, the user stories that should be satisfied.


### Basic stories

1. As a **potential client** looking to hire a team of developers
  > I want to **visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team**

  > so that I **get a concise description of what you have to offer me**

1. As a **potential client** looking to hire a team of developers
  > I want to **visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact'**

  > so I can **quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit**

1. As a **potential client** looking to hire a team of developers
  > I want to **be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information**

  > So that **the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards**

1. As a **potential client** looking to hire a team of developers
  > I want to **click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page**

  > So that I **can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded**

1. As a **potential client** looking to hire a team of developers
  > I want to **easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop**

  > so that I **can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in**


### Accessibility stories

1. As a **visually impaired potential client**
  > I would like to **easily read and understand the text on your site**

  > so I can **understand the information available**

1. As a **blind potential client**
  > I would like to **easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site**

  > so I can **understand the information available**

1. As a **potential client with JavaScript disabled in their browser** for security reasons
  > I would like **to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled**

  > so that I **don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age**


### Stretch goals

You are free to define any stretch goals that you want. Add them as user stories in your project's README.

Here are a few to give you some starting ideas:

1. As a **potential client** on a mobile device
  > I would like **to click on the hamburger icon to show the menu items**

  > so that I **can have a compact navigation and more space for content**

1. As a **potential client** using mobile, tablet or desktop,
  > I would like **to have the navigation sticking to the top of the window**

  > so that I **can always know the structure of the page**


## Build process

Your team needs to set up a new repository under your cohort's Github organisation and work together to commit changes to this repository.

Your repo should contain a README file with these three points -
- WHY (describing the purpose)
- WHAT (describing your site)
- HOW (describing the journey to completion)

Your website should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your *Linkedin*, *Github* and *Codewars* accounts.


## Technical requirements

Your project should be:
- built without using frameworks or libraries
- built mobile-first
- published on Github pages
- have a minimal but consistent CSS organisation

Would be nice if your project was:
- tested and optimised for accessibility tools
