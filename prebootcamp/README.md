# Prebootcamp

Before attending the bootcamp you are expected to complete the prerequisites and work as much as you can on the precourse material.


## Prerequisites

  - Register on [Github](https://www.github.com/)
  - Join our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone)
  - Register on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
  - Complete the following FreeCodeCamp sections:
    - HTML5 & CSS
    - Basic JavaScript
    - Object Oriented and Functional Programming
    - Basic Algorithm Scripting
  - Create your personal website using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  - Register on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
    - Reach kyu 5
    - [Create a kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript)


## Precourse material

The following material is meant as a reference for what you are expected to know before the bootcamp, but maybe you are not familiar yet.


### Command line

Having used the command line before the bootcamp is essential. You are not expected to be a pro, but you need to know your way around.

To achieve that you can:
  - start by watching and repeating the commands of this [gentle tutorial introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFMyUgF6I8Y).
  - if you have time, go deeper with [Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
  - please please please become a decent typist. It will pay off for the rest of your working career as probably you'll be typing all the way through. You can learn at [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) and have some fun at [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/)


### Git & Github

To collaborate with other on code you need to know the basics of git and Github.

If you have no idea what we are talking about you can watch this [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-) from Github (total of ~80 minutes, at normal speed).

Then be sure to put it into practice, at least by setting up your Github page. There is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for that too.


### Markdown

To share information on Github and beyond you need a way to format text. An easy way to do that on plain text files is Markdown.

You can read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from Github again. Be sure to try that out yourself by writing some documentation or presentation of your website hosted in the Github pages.
